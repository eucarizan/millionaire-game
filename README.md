## learning
you will learn how to handle browser events, work with json objects, and program game logic using js. this will save you from the fear of using javascript!

## about
some may think that front-end development is only about manufacturing similar web pages like online shops or landings. but the things you can program with html, css, and js are infinite and bounded with only your imagination. 

browser games are one of the items on this list because they do not always require a server, which means you can apply your skills and knowledge in the interface to create your own game, which is what the project is about. when creating a game, the emphasis will be on js. therefore, we will almost not use html and css here, and all html markup will be done using js.
